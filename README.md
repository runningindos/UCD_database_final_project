Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to try and create database connectivity between my website and my database while also allowing data to be added to the database and shared in the website. 

Key Sections: 
Home page - all navigation starts here, and introduces the purpose and use of the site

Login - this is where users will login if they've already registered. 

Register - this is where users will register upon visiting the site, and doing so will allow them to write stories

Read - this page is where stories will be populated once they are published. 

Write - this is where stories will be written by registered users.

Design: 
I want to make a very simple, yet elegant and modern website that facilitates the transer of inforation from the front-end to the back-end. I used colourblind friendly colours to make certain every user was able to enjoy the styling and design of the site to get the full experience.

The home page is the point of navigation, so there is no full navigation bar. Login and registration should send the user back to the home page to then select read or write. Users should then be redirected to the read page after writing a story, and from the read page, users have the ability to click the "write" button to take them to the write page, so navigation is built into natural user actions with the home page being the central aspect. No navigation bar further supports the clean minimalist design that is desired.

Audience:
The audience is anyone intersted in writing or reading amateur stories.
